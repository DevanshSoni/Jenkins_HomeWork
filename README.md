# Jenkins_HomeWork

This Repository is mainly focused on automating the job using Jenkins, 
This repository contains two branches, One branch works for the production server and other branch works for the testing server
Here I've acheived the concept of Continous Integration and Continous Deployment using docker for launching a dedicated OS for
both the servers or branches.

My Jenkins Contains three jobs :- <br>
Job1 :- This Job mainly work for the branch dev1 which is the Testing Server of this project.
Job2 :- Job2 mainly focuses on the Production Server to which the client will interact to.
Job3 :- This Job is for merging the two branches in order to put changes of Testing Server in the Production Server.
