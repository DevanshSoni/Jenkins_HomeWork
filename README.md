# Jenkins_HomeWork

This Repository is mainly focused on automating the job using Jenkins, <br>
This repository contains two branches, One branch works for the production server and other branch works for the testing server <br>
Here I've acheived the concept of Continous Integration and Continous Deployment using docker for launching a dedicated OS for
both the servers or branches.<br>
<br>
My Jenkins Contains three jobs :- <br>
Job1 :- This Job mainly work for the branch dev1 which is the Testing Server of this project.<br>
Job2 :- Job2 mainly focuses on the Production Server to which the client will interact to.<br>
Job3 :- This Job is for merging the two branches in order to put changes of Testing Server in the Production Server. <br>
